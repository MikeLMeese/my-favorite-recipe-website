    <h1>How to make Stir-fried eggs with tomatoes</h1>
    <p>This recipe serves 4 people</p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>Wash green onions and tomatoes</i></li>
        <li><i>Chop the green onions, making sure to separate the white parts from the green. Set
            aside.</i></li>
        <li><i>Cut the tomatoes in half, make a V-shaped incision at the top to remove the tough
            fibrous part of the tomato, then slice the tomatoes into small wedges. Set aside.</i></li>
        <li><i>In a bowl, crack the eggs into the bowl along and whisk them until the yolks and whites
            are combined.</i></li>
        <li><i>Set a pan over medium heat and add 1 tbsp cooking oil to the pan. Wait until
            oil is hot enough, then add in the eggs.</i></li>
        <li><i>Cook eggs until they are beginning to set but not completely cooked through.
            Remove and set aside (they will finish cooking later on)</i></li>
        <li><i>Add another tbsp of oil. Add the white parts of the green onion into the pan
            and stir-fry until fragrant (roughly 30 seconds or less depending on how hot your oil is).</i></li>
        <li><i>Add in the tomatoes and stir-fry for a couple minutes. Add salt and sugar to taste,
            then place a lid over the pan and cook the tomatoes to your desired softness. (anywhere
        from 3 to 7 minutes, the longer it cooks the softer the tomatoes will be).</i></li>
        <li><i>Remove lid from pan and add in the eggs. Using your spatula, break up the eggs into
            small chunks and mix everything together.</i></li>
        <li><i>Turn off the heat and place onto a big serving dish or in individual bowls with rice.
            Garnish with green onion and enjoy!</i></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Some additional tips and ideas</h2>
    <p>This recipe is the most basic and simple and is a staple in many Asian homes, but that doesn't
        mean you can't spruce it up! <br><br>You can add other things to the dish for more flavor. <b>Soy sauce,
        garlic, and onions</b> are common additions to this dish, so experiment with what you like!<br><br>To speed
        up the cooking process, have your pan and oil already set on your stovetop on medium heat as you're
        prepping the ingredients to cut down even more on time! <br><br>If you want the tomatoes to cook faster,
        you can cut the tomatoes into slices instead of wedges. Do pay attention though as those thinner
        slices will cook fast and, unless you like mushy, almost disntegrated tomatoes, you need to keep an
        eye on them!</p>
