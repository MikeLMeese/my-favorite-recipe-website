    <h1>Stir-fried Eggs with Tomatoes</h1>
    <p><b>Stir-fried eggs with Tomatoes</b> is one of my personal favorite dishes of all time. The slight
    acidic tang of the tomatoes coupled with the richness of the egg and the smell of green onion is
    always a treat for the mouth! Not only that, it is one of the simplest dishes to make, <i>in as little
    as 15 minutes</i>!</p>
